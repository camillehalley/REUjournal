	<h1> Closing Thoughts </h1>
	<h3> On a Project that Continues </h3>
	<p> I’ve been able to finish the design of Snag’ Em over the course of the summer, though there is still a good amount of site
  development left to complete.  Since I’d like my new interface to be utilized, I’m planning to continue working on the development of
  the site over the next few weeks.  Once this is up and running, there is the possibility of running a study to validate the design
  decisions I’ve made and examine the effects of Snag’ Em on it’s users.  </p>
