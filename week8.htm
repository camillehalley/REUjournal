	<h1> Week 7 </h1>
	<h3> Wow this is going by so fast... </h3>
	<p>We only have a two more weeks left!  It's all going by incredibly fast - seems surreal to be wrapping up our research already.
  With the end of the program coming up, I'm beginning to work on my poster and presentation for our symposium.  I'm also working to
  ensure the code I finish is at a level where it's useable and easily comprehensible, which it needs to be for the grad students
  working on Snag' Em next semester to use my interface design.  </p>
  <h3> Running & relaxing </h3>
	  <p>
    Cross country season is staring not that long from now, and I'm so excited to be back with the team for one last year of cross
    country! I'm raising my mileage a bit so I put a lot of time into running and recovering afterwards.  I spent the rest of my spare time 
    eating new kinds of food and watching stand-up comedy with friends.  After so many weeks of city wandering it was refreshing to spend 
    one just excercising, eating, and chilling on the couch with some of my favorite people.
