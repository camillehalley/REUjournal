	<h1> Week 5 </h1>
	<h3> Development </h3>
	<p> I’ve finished my basic design of Snag’ Em pages and I’m starting to integrate developmental game portions.  This involves sorting
  through the founders code to see which parts I wish to keep and which I would like to rewrite.  So far this has proven challenging as 
  I have no contact with the original developers and have yet to uncover the relationship between all of their old folders.  They also
  used php in their script, a language that is new to me.  </p>
  <h3> Charleston Beaches & Markets </h3>
	  <p> This weekend our REU traveled to Charleston for a practice conference.  I fell in love with the town, I'm very much
    considering trying to move here after college.  The more time I spend around here, the more I want to come 
    back one day.  The Charleston town streets are covered with quaint little shops, and every type of delicious food.  The architecture
    is beautiful, there are so many wonderful structures.  The ocean is warm and great for swimming, though the beaches don't capture
    me as much. I have a soft spot in my heart for the rocky, fog dwelling beaches of the northern Pacific where the ocean is too cold 
    and strong to invite swimming - but there's nothing better than a blanket, a bonfire, and the roar of the waves there. </p>
