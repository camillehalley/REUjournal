	<h1> Week 9 </h1>
	<h3> Lightning Talks & Posters </h3>
	<p> This week we had our lightning talks, a 5-minute presentation to our department and fellow researchers.  I spent some time
		preparing for this and designing my poster for our conference next Tuesday.  Designing presentations and posters was 
		an interesting change of pace yet I found myself missing uninterrupted timed dedicated to research.   </p>
  <h3> Board Games Downtown </h3>
<p>
We found a restaurant downtown that has shelves full of board games for guests to play.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday,
		  surrounded by good people, good food, and fun games.
