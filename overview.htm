	<h1> Snag' Em </h1>
	<h3> A Social Networking Game </h3>
	<p>  Snag' Em is a social networking game designed especialy for the academic community, especially at conferences and community colleges.
	Certain social dynamics offer uneven advantages to those that are especially extroverted or articulate.  Snag' Em offers a 
	way for less outgoing people to comfortably network and build a sense of community, as well as lower social boundaries
	created by language barriers and culture differences.  Since a sense of community is correlated 
	with involvement and retention [1], Snag' Em aims to collaterally improve these for users as well.  <br><br><br>
