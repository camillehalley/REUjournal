	<h1> Week 4 </h1>
	<h3> Design </h3>
	<p>This week I dove into the design of Snag’ Em’s pages and found some of the platforms I had planned to use were more difficult 
  than I anticipated.  Just in mind, for example, is a software supposed to simulate web design in a simplified development environment.  
  I had anticipated using this for a quick design that I could have human subjects attempt to navigate, make changes, and so on before
  writing out my final code.  However, I found this software lacked features I intended to incorporate and took enough time to navigate
  that it seemed it might slow rather than speed up the process.  Thus, I’ve opted to begin coding my initial design straight from html,
  css, and js.  I can then have people test navigation of the web pages themselves, which will be more representative than models.  I can 
  also make needed changing directly, and not have to worry later about differences between the development platform and the pages 
  themselves.  </p>
  <h3> Rooftops & City Adventures </h3>
	  <p> This week I saw my first Raleigh storm, it poured rain on us while we were out to sushi.  As one of those unusual souls 
		  who loves rainy, stormy weather I was delighted.  The runoff water on the side of the road was so full it was
		  river-like.  <br> I also spent a lot of time on the Raleigh rooftops.  Coming from small towns, rooftop restaurants 
			  are new to me and quite enjoyable  </p>
