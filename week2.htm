	<h1> Week 2 </h1>
	<h3> Labs </h3>
	<p>  We began the week with presentations of our data challenge projects from software bootcamp.  It was intriguing to see
    all of the different research questions people investigated.  With software bootcamp over, we were introduced to the myriad of
    labs REU researchers would be working in.  After hearing the possibilities, I chose to work in Dr. Barnes's lab with Yihuan
    Dong on a project called Snag' Em.  Snag' Em is a social networking game to help people in the scientific community meet
    eachother in contexts such as community college or research conferences.  The game's founders premeired it at a conference in
    2010 with relative success.  My role will be to redesign the interface so that the game is inviting and intuitive to new users. </p>
    <h3> Coffee </h3>
	<p> After spending so much time in Berkeley and Seattle surrounded by coffee hipster finatics, I must confess I think I've become
    one myself.  Thus I've been periodically venturing to try the various local cafes in search of a good latte.  </p>
