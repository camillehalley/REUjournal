	<h1> Week 3 </h1>
	<h3> The Design of Everyday Things and html </h3>
	<p>Most of my time this week has been dedicated to reading articles
	on effective interfaces, and reading The Design of Everyday Things, a book suggested by my mentor Yihuan.  I've found this book very
	interesting so far.  The author offers thoughts on affordances and conceptual models, two elements of an intuitive design.  Affordances
	are instances in which there is only one clear way to accomplish the given task.  For instance, you know immediatley to push a door that has
	only a mounted plate where a handle would go on a door you might pull.  This is because without a handle, you cannot pull or
	slide the door; therefore, you must push.  Contrarily, a door given a handle that is meant to be pushed often confuses users.
	So generally, if a layout can be designed so that the only clear way to accomplish a task is the intended path of action,
	users will intuitively navigate the layout as desired.  The author also discussed conceptual models; essentially, if you can
	map controls of a novel layout to a familiar layout, interaction comes intuitively.  For example, if a hovercraft were controlled
	by a steering wheel and acceleration pedals similar to that of a car, a car driver could easily control the hover craft, having never
	done so previously.  The difficulty with conceptual maps is they are often culture dependent, and thus standardizing them becomes
	difficult. As I continue with planning the design of Snag' Em, affordances and conceptual maps are two elements I intend to 
	  incorporate.  </p>
