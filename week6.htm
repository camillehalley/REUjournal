	<h1> Week 6 </h1>
	<h3> Php and Old Snag' Em Code </h3>
	<p> This week was probably the most challenging so far, I’ve found the old Snag’ Em code difficult to understand and the people who
  wrote it aren’t around.  I found it so frustrating I almost began developing the game from scratch.  However, after realizing how long
  that would take I went back and took another look at the old code.  It seemed cryptic to me at first because I’m new to js and
  completely unfamiliar with php.  However, my mentor Yihuan went through parts with me and helped translate some of the php to javascript
  (as we intend not to use php in our newly designed site).  This helped me understand both what the php and javascript were doing, and 
  incorporating old code into our new site seems somewhat less daunting now.  </p>
  <h3> Rock Climbing </h3>
	  <p> This week some friends took me rock climbing at a nearby gym.  This was my first experience climbing, and we stayed from 7 till
    the gym closed at 11.  My hands and arms were so sore the next day that even typing was a bit slower, but I can’t wait to go back!
    My friend is going to teach me how to belay soon as well so hopefully I’ll be climbing a lot more this summer!  </p>
