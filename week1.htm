	<h1> Week 1 </h1>
	<h3> Software Bootcamp </h3>
	<p>  We started off the first week with software bootcamp.  Various faculty and graduate students came in
	and explained parts of github, R, and MySQL. We were then given data logs from a local company and asked
	to propose a research question to which we could respond by analyzing the given data.  My partner and I questioned
	if long concentrated hours would lead to higher error rates than more reasonable and distributed hours.  We hypothesized
	that long concentrated would indeed lead to coutnerproductive results.  We analyzed the data in Rstudio, and though our
	findings were insigificant, they aligned with our hypothesis. <br> </p>
	<h3> Fireflies & Sweet Tea </h3>
	<p>On my evening runs I see fireflies everywhere,
	it's almost mystical to me, I'd only really read about fireflies before now.  I'm also new to sweet tea, and especially
	enjoying a lemonade-sweet tea combo - sort of a southern Arnold Palmer. </p>
