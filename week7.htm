	<h1> Week 7 </h1>
	<h3> Integration of Design and Development </h3>
	<p> This week I have begun integrating development changes I made to the Snag’ Em code into my website design.  This process makes me
  appreciate how much must go into large-scale websites like Amazon and Facebook.  Things that seem simple from the outside, like
  ensuring that your avatar updates on all pages after editing it in an editor window, turn out to be surprisingly complex.  My project
  was delayed slightly behind my projected progress by instances in which I became stuck during development, though I think I’ll be able 
  to catch up next week.   </p>
  <h3> Trail Running & More City Exploring </h3>
	  <p>
    I’ve been running on the same kind-of-sort-of-half-a-trail the whole time I’ve been here, and this week I finally found some real, 
    dirt, winding-through-the-trees style trails.  It was so refreshing!!  As much as I love NC, I miss my favorite west coast
    never-ending trails, and it was good to find their eastern counterparts. <br> 
    This week again, I made it into the city to try out some new places.  I ate large quantities of sushi at a new sushi bar in town and 
    tried cookies from the local bakery.
