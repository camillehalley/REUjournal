	<h1> Week 9 </h1>
	<h3> NCSU Undergraduate Conference </h3>
	<p> This week we presented our research at NCSU’s undergraduate conference.  All subjects were combined, so I enjoyed getting a 
		look at some of the biological and psychological research that has been going on, as these are two subjects I enjoy quite 
		a lot.  I found presenting and discussing my research with interested individuals who stopped by fulfilling and
		intriguing, many had interesting comments and suggestions to contribute.  </p>
  <h3> Bittersweet Goodbyes </h3>
<p> Most of my free time this week was dedicated to spending time with the people I’ve grown closest to over the summer.  I’ve enjoyed
	many of the connections and friendships I’ve made over the last few months, and intend to hold onto a few despite the distance 
	that will soon be between us.  It’s been a refreshing summer for me full of challenges and their conquering, the trials of
	learning and learning by trial, and time well spent with food between friends.    </p>
