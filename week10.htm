	<h1> Week 9 </h1>
	<h3> NCSU Undergraduate Conference </h3>
	<p> This week we presented our research at NCSU’s undergraduate conference.  All subjects were combined, so I enjoyed getting a 
		look at some of the biological and psychological research that has been going on, as these are two subjects I enjoy quite 
		a lot.  I found presenting and discussing my research with interested individuals who stopped by fulfilling and
		intriguing, many had interesting comments and suggestions to contribute.  </p>
